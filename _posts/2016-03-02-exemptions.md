A single page application that was the first project that I was a lead developer managing other developers from start to finish.  This project consisted of a single page application that allowed users to fill out a series of questions to see if they got any tax breaks for when they had or didn't have health insurance.  My team would later take this application and build a framework around it using bower to install individual modules that could be used to create other screeners.
