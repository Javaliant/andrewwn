I worked on this project while working for Aquilent. This was mostly an operations and maintance type of project, but there were certainly a few updates that I made to it, for example, the landings component to the system. This was my first exposure to e-commerce types of web sites. I ended up converting the web site from its current shopping cart and credit card processing pieces to Pay.gov and a custom built shopping cart.
