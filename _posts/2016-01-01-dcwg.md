This was my first major application that I developed from scratch coming out of school.  I worked on a team of 6 and was the main developer supporting the application.  Being as though it was my first major application I was developing I had tremendous support from my team and was the first chance I got to work with a certified DBA who taught me a lot about database performance.  The hard work of the entire team made this a big success for us.
