This was my first chance to work with a commercial-off-the-shelf product and it happened to be Microsoft Sharepoint Team Services. Once again the product was for DISA's EDGE portal and the goal was to build a number of communities of interest very quickly. I was a programmer and system administrator in charge of this project.
