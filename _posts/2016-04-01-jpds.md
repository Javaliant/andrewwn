My first WordPress website where I worked with a team of 2 other people to develop a refreshed version of the JPDS website and blog.  We are continuing to work on this and add new functionality including more search functionality, FAQs, and other sections that require modifications to plugins being used throughout the site.  Also, this is my first crack at really looking at and analyzing information architecture for sites and plans to work with more analytics for the site as well.
