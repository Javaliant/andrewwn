A freelance project that entailed converting an existing site over to Jekyll from a defunct CMS.  I have since made the site fully responsive by incorporating bootstrap along with a number of javascript enhancements to the site.  My work continues with this client and more updates are being made continuously.  I really have enjoyed working with very knowledgeable folks who really understand how development needs to be done!
