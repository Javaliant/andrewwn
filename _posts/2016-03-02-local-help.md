Another single page application that was originally developed by myself and then after a couple of iterations, oversaw and helped my team to develop the current version.  This was the first project that exposed me to using Node.js as a full stack application tier.  My team built a REST API to interface between the client and the database to retrieve results as well as provide instructions to another client application that was used to manage the backend data.
