I built SAT while working for Northrop Grumman IT. The project was for DISA and their knowledge management portal called the EDGE (Enterprise Data and Global Exchange). The original requirements wanted SAT to just be a reporting tool integrating other systems within DISA, however the scope continually changed over the years. It finally morphed into a very flexible tool to allow organizations within DISA to automate the collection of status information and provide custom filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. It was my baby for a couple years and allowed me to learn a number of new technologies including LDAP, web services, SOAP, WSDL, XML, and Netegrity SiteMinder. Unfortunately at this time I can only provide screen captures of the project. Please click the view link above to view those.
