Most of the work I have done has been built for internal business and government use only, so it is not possible to release the full blown applications. However, if you have any additional questions on them I can be contacted at andrewwn@gmail.com"

I moved from Virginia to Baltimore and switched to Aquilent where I worked until 2016. If you add it all up it equals over 15 years of on the job experience and 20 years of developing!"

A collaborative leader who is particularly skilled in architecting databases and developing the user interface to meet the stated requirements.  A gifted and agile learner as evidenced by quickly adapting to other skills such as project management and network administration.<br/><br/>Snowboarding is my favorite non-technical hobby, so that will explain why I decided to combine some aspects of a couple of activities that I do well!"
